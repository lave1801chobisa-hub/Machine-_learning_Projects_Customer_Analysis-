Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning
Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning
By analyzing purchase patterns and demographic data, I was able to segment customers into meaningful groups that can help businesses personalize marketing, improve retention, and boost revenue.

🔍 Tech used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, K-Means
📊 Key steps: Data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, cluster visualization
💡 Outcome: Clear segmentation that reveals high-value customers and distinct behavior groups.
Family sizes differ across categories: Some categories have mostly small families (purple), while others have larger families (green, blue).
Outliers exist: Red dots show unusual family sizes for their category.
Density: Categories like purple and teal have high density at specific family sizes, suggesting those sizes are more common in those categories.
Excited to apply these insights to real-world business problems!
